Code for sonic microscope 


Using open-source and DIY electronics, Sonic Microscope translates what it sees into sound. It creates ‘pixel watchers’ which constantly scan the image for changes in brightness, colour and movement of objects and organisms in the frame. Patterns in appearance and behaviour create signature sounds for each subject. Sonic Microscope offers new ways of exploring and interacting with parts of our surroundings that generally remain invisible and hidden. 

The idea behind creating such tools is to encourage people to investigate and create new experiences that question our understanding of what surrounds us. The Sonic Microscope has been used extensively over the past year for mapping landscapes in Finland.
